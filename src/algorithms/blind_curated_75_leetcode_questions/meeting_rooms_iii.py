"""
    Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.

    To do this, you’ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. In HiCal, a meeting is stored as a tuple ↴ of integers (start_time, end_time). These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.

    For example:

    (2, 3)  # Meeting from 10:00 – 10:30 am
    (6, 9)  # Meeting from 12:00 – 1:30 pm

    Write a function merge_ranges() that takes a list of multiple meeting time ranges and returns a list of condensed ranges.

    For example, given:

    [(0, 1), (3, 5), (4, 8), (10, 12), (9, 10)]

    your function would return:

    [(0, 1), (3, 8), (9, 12)]

    Do not assume the meetings are in order. The meeting times are coming from multiple teams.

    Write a solution that's efficient even when we can't put a nice upper bound on the numbers representing our time ranges. Here we've simplified our times down to the number of 30-minute slots past 9:00 am. But we want the function to work even for very large numbers, like Unix timestamps. In any case, the spirit of the challenge is to merge meetings where start_time and end_time don't have an upper bound.
