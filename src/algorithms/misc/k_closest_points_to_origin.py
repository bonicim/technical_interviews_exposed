    """
    We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

    (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

    You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

    Example 1:

    Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
    Output: [[-2,2]]
    Explanation:
    The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
    The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
    Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
    We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
    Example 2:

    Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
    Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
    (The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)

def divide_conquer_solution(points, kth):
    """
    The key idea is that we need to select the kth closest point to the origin.
    Unlike the sorting_solution which uses the quicksort algorithm and runs in O(n log n),
    this solution uses a selction algorithm called quickselect, which is related to quicksort.

    Quickselect uses the same overall approach as quicksort, choosing one element as a pivot and partitioning the data in two based on the pivot, accordingly as less than or greater than the pivot.
    However, instead of recursing into both sides, as in quicksort, quickselect only recurses into one side â€“ the side with the element it is searching for.
    This reduces the average complexity from O(n log n) to O(n), with a worst case of O(n^2).
    You can think of quickselect as a partialsort sorting algorithm.

    This question basically tests your knowledge of sorting and selection algorithms.
