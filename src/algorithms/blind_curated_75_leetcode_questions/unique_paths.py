""" Commentary
This problem tests your command of searching algorithms and dynamic programming, both
of which can solve this question.

There are many ways to solve this:
BFS
DFS
Recursion
Top Down Memoization
Bottom Up Tabulation

If you're stuck and don't know where to start, one strategy is to step through a simple example

The dynamic programming solution is quite easy to grasp. The best way to do that is to draw a picture of the search space. Then given the constraints of the problem,
update the number of total paths to each box. In this case, the top and left rows should all have a value
of 1 because there is only one way to that box given the constraints of the problem.

After that, we notice that we can the determine the number of ways to each box by looking at the number of
ways to get to that box's previous boxes or neighbors. We keep going through the whole matrix until we reach
the target. At that point, we will have arrived at the answer which was built on the answers of previous smaller problems.
