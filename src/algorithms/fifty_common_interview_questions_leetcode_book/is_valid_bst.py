"""
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

"""

""" Commentary

The interesting thing about this problem and the solution is that it uses DFS as a strategy to
determine if a tree is a valid BST. Moreover, in order to know if it is a valid BST, we have to initially
set arbitrary lower and upper bounds to determine validity at a node. If the node is valid, then
we need to check the left and right subtree, but with adjusted lower and upper bounds, namely coming from the
parent node. For example, the left child should be greater than the lower bound and less than the current node' value.
For the the right child, the child should be greater than the current node but less than the upper bound.

In both solutions, I purposely stop checking the right side if the left side has already been determined to be
invalid. In this way, I avoid validating both sides. I simply need to know if any side is invalid. If I knew
the left side was invalid, then there is no need to check the right side.
