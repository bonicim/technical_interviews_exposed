# Given a list of integers as the leafs of a binary tree, create a balanced binary tree, in which
# the sum of a node's children will equal the node's value.
# Return the root of the binary tree.
#
# Print the binary tree as the following:
# For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 10]
# Print the following balanced binary tree
#                  [23,
#                  9, 14,
#               3, 6, 14, 0
#          1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 10, 0, 0]
